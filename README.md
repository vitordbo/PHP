Simple repository with details and explanations about PHP

I'm using XAMPP (Apache distribution containing MariaDB, PHP, and Perl) to run my PHP files

* PHP code is executed on the server and the result is returned to the browser as plain HTML

Before you continue you should have a basic understanding of the following:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

PHP files can contain text, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP code and have extension ".php"
* PHP can generate dynamic page content
* PHP can modify files on the server
* PHP can collect form data


PHP can do a lot of things :)
