    //File handling is an important part of any web application. 
    //You often need to open and process a file for different tasks.

    /*
    PHP has several functions for creating, reading, uploading, and editing files.
    Be careful when manipulating files!

    You can do a lot of damage if you do something wrong. Common errors are: 
    editing the wrong file, filling a hard-drive with garbage data, and deleting the
    content of a file by accident.

    fopen() -> open / create 
    fwrite() -> write on the file
    fclose() -> close the file
    feof() -> checks if the "end-of-file" (EOF) has been reached
    fgets() ->  is used to read a single line from a file
    file_get_contents() -> read all file and put in a string
    file_put_contents() -> create a file
    unlink() -> delete a file
    copy() -> copy a file
