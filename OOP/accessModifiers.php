    /*
        Access Modifiers
        Properties and methods can have access modifiers which control where they can be accessed.

        There are three access modifiers:

        public - the property or method can be accessed from everywhere. This is default
        protected - the property or method can be accessed within the class and by classes derived from that class
        private - the property or method can ONLY be accessed within the class

        In the following example we have added three different access modifiers to three properties
        (name, color, and weight). Here, if you try to set the name property it will work fine 
        (because the name property is public, and can be accessed from everywhere). However, 
        if you try to set the color or weight property it will result in a fatal error 
        (because the color and weight property are protected and private):

    */

    class Fruit {
        public $name;
        protected $color;
        private $weight;

    }
    
    $mango = new Fruit();
    $mango->name = 'Mango'; // OK
    $mango->color = 'Yellow'; // ERROR
    $mango->weight = '300'; // ERROR
?>
